So I'm still new with using GitHub, and it's already giving me headaches. I'm still learning how to upload source codes and projects. I've been told that it is usefl to save my code somewhere safe whenever I need to use them again, so I'm using GitHub for that. I am using OneNote to save my files too, but I think I like the format of GitHub more. Right now, I'm just comparing which one is better.
